Why do situationships hurt and feel so good at same time?...Maybe its the False Hope that we holding onto with that one person...the feeling of love that they show us and wht it feels to be finally in a "relationship".
I recently got out of a very wonderful situationship...i dont regret it ..we both were self aware and not ready for the realtionships. Wht we thought would be just a 2 week conversation ended up wfor an almost a year of ups and downs.
We were too good to be true...like almost a couple but scared to commit...at the end we ended the things so we can focus on ourselves. But I am glad we ended this.on a good note.
Since this was few days before thats why its keep moving in my mind...wht if we were "Right person Wrong time" thing...wht if we were the one for each other and now i am not gonna se him again.
But thats something my brain would tell me cause i got adicted to this feeling.. I keep saying in my socials feeds that no commitments means its just timepass...but that was not we had.
It was so pure and precious..just we both had so much in our life and how much we wanted to become best first before getting into this dating world.
But Was this toxic?....Could we had something more?....Should we had just tried to worked it out instead of letting it go completely?....Would we meet again?
